## Retro Asteroids Game

This project was written in **Python** using **pygame**. It's a simple game of
Asteroids that some may remember as a retro arcade game.

I wrote this as part of my courses @**[Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/)** and it was
a great learning experience since I've rarely used pygame before.

In its current state, it's increadably simple, but functional.

### To-Do

If I was to expand upon the game, I would add the following features:

- A main menu and game over screen
- Score tracking and high score system
- Sound effects
- Basic animations

A game like this should be kept simple, but these features can make it feel
modern while keeping its classic charm.
